# ENED1120 Project 5
My Python code for the final demonstration of Project 5 of the ENED1120 class at the University of Cincinnati

# ABOUT
Code runs on the ev3dev OS installed on a Mindstorms EV3 brick. 

# NOTICE
This code was uploaded for the purpose of demonstrating how my robot was programmed. I trust that you do not copy my code exactly. If you want some help with your own robot, email me at yogeshbv@mail.uc.edu and I'll gladly help.
